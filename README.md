# hamblin-docs-darkmode
This repository is just the CSS to make his documentation Dark Mode, seeing that you cannot do anything with CSS without the source code for it. This isn't really leaking, however if he requests I take it down, I'll do so no problem.

---

Simply just drag and drop this CSS into your documentation's css folder, and you will have darkmode!
